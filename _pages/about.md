Hello! I am a PhD student in Economics at <b> University of California, San Diego </b>. I am interested in applied microeconomics, particularly in behavioral economics, development economics, political economy and experimental economics. 

I hold an M.A. in Economics and B.A degrees in Economics and Political Science from Universidad de los Andes.

Previously, I worked as a predoctoral research fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank, as a research consultant at the World Bank, and as a research assistant at Universidad de Los Andes and Universidad del Rosario
