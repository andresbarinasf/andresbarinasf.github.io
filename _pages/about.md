Hola! I work as a research assistant at the Center for Studies on Economic Development (CEDE) at Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia. I previously worked at Fedesarrollo, Banco de la Rep√∫blica and the Department of Economics at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. My fields of interest are public economics, political economy and labor economics.

Next summer I will join Stanford University as a predoctoral research fellow at [SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/).

I hold an M.A. in economics from Universidad de los Andes and a B.A. in economics from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

My email is jd.torres15@uniandes.edu.co
